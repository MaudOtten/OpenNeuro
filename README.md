## OpenNeuro Project - Maud Ottenheijm 20201

- Aim:
A replication project on open-source neuroimaging data from 'Functional reorganization of brain networks across the human menstrual cycle' by Pritschet et al. (2020, Neuroimage)[^1].

- Methods:
Using only open-source analysis tools (Oracle, SPM standalone, OpenNeuro, etc.) to recreate an fMRI analysis pipeline and replicate results found in a published study. Data is publically available on OpenNeuro, code on Github. These, along with the paper's explanation of the analysis, are used to perform all steps of the analysis and replicate the results found by Pritschet et al.

- Results:
